A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and connections (edges) that represent relationships. 
Graphs can be directed or undirected, and may be weighted or unweighted depending on whether edges carry direction or cost.
They are widely used in networking, social media, pathfinding, and recommendation systems to model complex connections.
