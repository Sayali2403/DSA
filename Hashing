Hashing is a technique that maps data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values called hash codes using hash functions. 
It is widely used in hash tables for fast data retrieval, where keys are converted into indices. 
Hashing helps in applications like databases, cryptography, and caching by ensuring efficient lookups and secure data handling
