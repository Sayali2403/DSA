A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the most recently added element is the first to be removed. 
It supports two main operations: push (to insert an element) and pop (to remove the top element), along with peek to view the top without removing it.
Stacks are widely used in applications like expression evaluation, function call management, and undo operations in software.
