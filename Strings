- A string is a sequence of characters stored together, like "Hello". In Java, strings are objects of the String class, not primitive types.
- Once created, a string cannot be changed. Any modification (like concatenation or replacement) creates a new string object instead of altering the original.
- Strings support many built‑in methods (length(), charAt(), substring(), equals(), etc.) and are widely used in text processing, searching, pattern matching, and data input/output.
