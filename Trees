A tree is a hierarchical data structure made up of nodes, with one node designated as the root and others connected as children.
Each node can have multiple child nodes, but only one parent, forming a branching structure. 
Trees are widely used in computer science for tasks like searching, sorting, and representing hierarchical relationships such as file systems or organizational charts
